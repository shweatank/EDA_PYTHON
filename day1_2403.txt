Electric Field: A region around electric charges where forces act on other charges.

Magnetic Field: A field created by moving electric charges, unlike an electric field created by stationary charges.

Conductor vs. Insulator:

Insulator: Materials (e.g., rubber, glass) that resist electricity and heat flow.

DIGITAL ELECTRONICS:
====================
Digital electronics processes signals that are represented as discrete values, typically 0 (low voltage) and 1 (high voltage).
-->represents discrete values(0,1)
0-----------no voltage(0v)
1-----------full voltage(5v)


BIPOLAR JUNCTION TRANSISTORS:
-----------------------------
It is a current controlled device.
The three terminals of the BJT are the base, the collector, and the emitter.


BASE:[like a gate to handle the current flow]
----
base that controls the current flow between the emitter and collector.
base forms two circuits,the input circuits with the emitter and the output circuit with controller.

EMITTER:
--------
the emitter is heavily doped and supplies the majority charge carriers(holes in NPN,electrons in PNP transistors).
emitter based junction is forward biased.
-->typically input terminal.

COLLECTOR:
---------
The collector is moderately doped and collects the majority charge carriers supplied by the emitter.
The collector-base junction is reverse-biased.
-->typically output terminal.

characterized by their semiconductor material structure:
========================================================
    NPN:1[appiled],0[not applicable]
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
      Consists of a thin, positively-doped (P-type) semiconductor material sandwiched between two negatively-doped (N-type) materials.
      When a positive voltage is applied to the base, a larger current flows from the collector to the emitter.
       NPN transistors are often referred to as "sinking" because they sink current from the load into the output.
       Widely used in amplifiers, switches, and logic gates.


     PNP:0[appiled],1[not applicable].
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
    Consists of a thin, negatively-doped (N-type) semiconductor material sandwiched between two positively-doped (P-type) materials.
    When a negative voltage is applied to the base, a larger current flows from the emitter to the collector.
    PNP transistors are often referred to as "sourcing" because they source current from the output to the load.
    Used in circuits where the current flows from positive to negative.

DIODE:
======
It is semiconductor device which allows current to flow in uni-direction,while blocking the others.

we used to control the flow of direction in a circuit.
  p-type----->majority of holes
  n-type----->majority of electrons
when the diode is forward bias,it allow current to flow.
when the diode is reverse bias,the holes pulled towards the negative and electrons pulled towards the positive and this cause the barrier to expand.
Therefore,the diode act as a insulator to prevent the flow of exceution.

semiconductor is a material with electrical conductivity between a conductor
and insulator.used in electronic devices like diodes,transistors,IC[integrated circuits].

semiconductor has a unique property of allowing electricity to flow,
but not as readily as conductors (like metals) or insulators (like glass).

HALF ADDER AND FULL ADDER:
==========================
HALF ADDER:
++++++++++
 A combinational logic circuit that adds two single-bit binary numbers (A and B).
 Sum (S): The result of the addition without considering any carry.
 Carry (C): A carry-out bit, which is 1 if the sum is greater than or equal to 2 (10 in binary).

         Sum (S) = A XOR B (Exclusive OR)

A CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) Inverter is a fundamental digital logic gate built using CMOS technology.

A Field-Effect Transistor (FET) is a type of transistor that uses an electric field to control the flow of current in a semiconductor channel. FETs are widely used in electronic devices and circuits due to their efficiency, high input impedance, and low power consumption. The most common types of FETs are MOSFETs (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors), which are the foundation of most modern electronic devices.
